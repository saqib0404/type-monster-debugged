            <h4>3. How many ways can we get "undefined" in JS?</h4>
            <p class="px-4">
                The ways by which we can get "undefined" are:- <br>
                1. A variable that has not been assigned a value. <br>
                2. A function returns undefined if a value was not returned. <br>
                3. . A statement also returns undefined if the variable that is being used does not have an assigned
                value.
            </p>

            <h4>4. How does Js event loop work?</h4>
            <p class="px-4">
                JavaScript is single-threaded an it has got a call stack that executes the code line by line
                synchronously. The event loop connects the tasks that are waiting to get executed in the JS call stack.
                If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to
                the Call Stack. The event loop monitors the Call Stack and the Callback Queue.
